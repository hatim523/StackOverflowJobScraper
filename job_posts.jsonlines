{"job_title": "Senior Developer: Applied Cryptography Solutions - Remote", "company": "SpiderOak", "company_logo": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/146ll.jpg", "description": "About SpiderOak\r\nWe want to change the world, and we\u2019ve already done it once. SpiderOak has been building encrypted software since before the first iPhone was released.\r\nSpiderOak is committed to building secure and reliable software that protects our customers\u2019 data. Our approach is fundamentally different from most mainstream security companies. Instead of adding layers of security on top of an insecure system, we build software that is inherently secure.\r\nHow are we different?\r\nSpiderOak builds need-to-know technology that supports customers working in hostile environments. Traditional systems trust IT infrastructure to maintain the whole security system, even though the news is rife with evidence that this model does not work. Our software combines end to end encryption with a distributed ledger (aka Blockchain) technology to offer best-in-class security with no backdoors.\r\nThe Distributed Ledger, SpiderOak Model\r\nA distributed ledger approach can provide compartmentalization of data that does not suffer from a single point of failure and is both fast and cost-effective. Compartments are defined using an irrefutable distributed ledger, enabling complete confidence in who is allowed to participate. Once the list of allowed users is defined, it becomes easy for those parties to negotiate shared encryption keys to secure the data being collaborated on.\r\nOur approach allows for the instant provisioning of cryptographically secure collaboration spaces for use in scenarios where certainty about who has access to that space is a mission requirement.\r\nAbout SpiderOak Engineering\r\nOur Engineering team is comprised of passionate and creative people who are committed to the premise that complexity is the enemy of security. The problem of security will not be solved by layering on more band-aids, e.g. firewalls, packet inspection, two-factor authentication, etc\u2026 these actually add complexity by increasing the attack surface. We take a fundamentally different approach by removing the need to trust your infrastructure or your admins through the combination of\r\n\r\nZero-trust systems and applied cryptography\r\nDistributed ledger\r\n\r\nOur platform and applications \u2013 built on Go \u2013 enable our customers to collaborate and communicate securely, and we\u2019re looking for growing the team to help us turn this ambitious vision into reality. Our culture is focused on productivity and creativity, and we\u2019re committed to collaboration with our colleagues across the organization.\r\nJob Description\r\nRather than bore you with a long description, let\u2019s cut to chase: your job is to implement security software in Go. Some of the specifications will be already written, but others will require you to design new solutions or features in partnership with our Security Architects.

If you are a motivated and self-driven developer who will enjoy learning and growing together with us, then we\u2019d love to talk to you.\r\nAbout LMAX\r\nWe design, build and operate FX exchanges in London, Tokyo and New York - facilitating the exchange of over $20 billion a day of currencies between a wide range of customers, including most of the world\u2019s top banks and other financial institutions.\r\nWe are also the home of the world's leading institutional Cryptocurrency exchange and have a best in class custodian system that secures our customer\u2019s Cryptocurrency funds.\r\nLMAX\u2019s mission is to transform trading in the world\u2019s biggest financial markets, bringing fairness, openness and transparency - creating a level playing field for all to participate. We are looking for people who want to help us change the game, not just play it.\r\nWhat you\u2019ll work on\r\nThe LMAX dev team works across the whole of the business. To avoid accumulating knowledge silos, we actively rotate developers around our teams, ensuring that everyone gains first-hand knowledge on all areas of our codebase and gets to work on a wide variety of projects, such as:\r\n\r\nDesigning and building software for low latency trading systems\r\nInvestigating new block chain technologies\r\nAnalytics tools to help senior management make data-led business decisions\r\nImproving our platform\u2019s security and resilience\r\n\r\nOur tech stack\r\n\r\nBackend: distributed, event-driven core Java (90% of the code base), MySQL\r\nFrontend: Javascript, Vue.js\r\nData analytics: Python &amp; Jupyter notebooks, Parquet, Docker\r\nBlockchain integrations: Bitcoin (&amp; Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash), Ethereum and XRP (Ripple)\r\nTesting: JUnit, Mockito, JMH, JCStress, Jenkins, Selenium, many in-house tools\u2026\r\nOS: Linux (CentOS)\r\n\r\nDue to our strict performance requirements, some bits of our architecture aren\u2019t entirely conventional... We don\u2019t expect you to arrive with an in-depth knowledge of all of our stack - we\u2019ll teach you that.\r\nWhat you\u2019ll bring\r\n\r\nA good understanding of how to write clean, efficient, well tested code\r\nA keenness to learn and to work in a highly collaborative environment\r\nStrong communication and problem-solving skills\r\nAn appreciation that the simple solution to a problem - while often harder to discover than the complex one - is usually best\r\n\r\nOur Values\r\nWorking collaboratively: We work in a very social and collaborative environment, even while remote. Working as a team and with colleagues from across the business, allows multiple ideas to combine into stronger designs and better solutions. Pair programming ensures high quality code, supports knowledge growth and sharing of expertise. With many eyes contributing to any code before it goes into production, you will rarely find a traditional code review at LMAX.\r\nTest driven: LMAX relies heavily on test driven development and automation. We gain rapid feedback and confidence from 35,000 end-to-end tests running every half an hour. There are also extensive unit, compatibility, migration, and resilience tests.We care a lot more about software performance than many other organisations. We have a range of continuous performance tests designed to catch any regression before it reaches production, from targeted microbenchmarks to end-to-end replays of production traffic.\r\nDedicated to quality: We care a lot about quality; we like to dig deep into the code-base and leave things better than we found them - more readable, better modelled, more performant, more consistent. There is a permanent expectation of delivering high quality, maintainable code, and minimising technical debt.\r\nYou won\u2019t be stressed about deadlines and pressured to cut corners just to get things done quickly. As a team we enjoy building software and seeing that software used, and although we want to deliver things in a timely manner, we always strive to write things properly and cleanly the first time.\r\nAlways improving: We regularly examine our successes and failures to look at how we can improve both as a team and individually. Alongside regular internal training sessions, we have a generous budget supporting attendance at conferences or training courses and we set aside Friday afternoons as a time for developers to pursue an interest or learn something.\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nSmart, friendly colleagues keen to share their knowledge and learn new things from you\r\nThe opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, including cutting edge technology, and interesting technical &amp; performance challenges\r\nA culture where high quality maintainable code is valued over quick hacks\r\nGenerous funding pot for training courses and conferences\r\nFlexible working options, and home working support\r\nCompetitive salary\r\n25 days holiday (increasing to 30 with service), plus bank holidays\r\nA benefits suite including ride to work &amp; electric car schemes, private medical insurance, life insurance and critical illness cover, pension plan, gym membership &amp; more\r\nRelaxed dress-code\r\nThink you know every IntelliJ shortcut?
